###Media Impact Project Dashboard ###
The Media Impact Project (MIP) Dashboard is an open-source dashboard used together with the MIP Data Repository as part of the Media Impact Project's Media Impact Measurement System.  

The MIP Dashboard and the following documentation were created for use on the Google Cloud Platform. Some additional work may be required to run the MIP Dashboard on other platforms. 

###Dashboard Overview###

The MIP Dashboard application is a PHP based application that runs on Google App Engine using the popular Laravel Framework for modular, agile feature development. The MIP Dashboard uses a Google Cloud based MYSQL database for application performance and cost reasons. The Dashboard includes automated ETL processes that run queries to extract the necessary data from the data source and enter it into the MYSQL database to be available for the Dashboard to display. Currently, there the dashboard has connectors for pulling data from Google BigQuery and Google Analytics into MYSQL and displaying on the Dashboard. 


###State of Project

The MIP Dashboard is freely available for use under the Apache 2.0 open source license. â€‹The Media Impact Project is a division of the Norman Lear Center at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. It is funded by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with additional funding from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Open Society Foundations.
